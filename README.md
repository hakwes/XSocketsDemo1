XSocketsDemo1
=============

A realtime communication SPA based on XSockets.NET, Wijmo, KnockoutJS, TwitterBootstrap and EF CF MSSQL as DataSource 

## What this?
This project was created on demand from a XSockets.NET user.

The project was built in one day, and its just a proof of concept that you can replace MVC/WebForms
with a realtime backend!!!

In the package is a readme.txt where all the steps is documented.

(Package may be updated in the future)

Uffe, Team Xsockets
